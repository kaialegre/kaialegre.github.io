  <h1>How to Pour Latte Art - Rosetta</h1>
  <p>Once your cup is 50% full, you need to move closer to the surface of the drink <br>
    with your pitcher. See the picture above how close the pitcher's spout is to <br>
    the drink's surface. Now we will start pouring the actual pattern. Pour again to the <br>
    middle of cup even though the pattern will move to the bottom of the cup. <br>
    By pouring "fast" you will get the pattern to spread and move to the bottom.</p>
