			Ever since people have been writing things down, they
			have had to consider their audience before actually
			putting pen to paper: letters would have to look different
			depending on whether they were to be read by
			mainly other people (in official documents or inscriptions),
			just one other person (in a letter), or only the
			writer (in a notebook or diary). There would be less
			room for guesswork if letter shapes were made more
			formal as the diversity of the readership expanded.</p>

	<h4>
			Some of the first messages to be read by a large number
				of people were rendered not by pens but by chisels.
				Large inscriptions on monuments in ancient Rome
				were carefully planned, with letter drawn on the stone
				with a brush before they were chiseled. Even if whiteout
				had existed in those days, it would not have helped
				to remove mistakes made in stone. A bit of planning
				was also more important then, since stonemasons were
				sometimes more expendable than slabs of marble. </h4>

<h5><p>Graphic design and typography are complicated activities,
but even the simple projects benefit from thinking
about the problem, forming a mental picture of the solution,
and then carefully planning the steps between.
Scientists have not been content with just calling the
human face “beautiful” if it meets certain ideals, or “ugly”
if it doesn’t. They had to go out and measure proportions
of nose to jaw, forehead to chin, and so on to establish
why some faces are more appealing than others.
Typographers and graphic designers often choose
typefaces for the very same reason they might fancy
a person: They just like that person. For more scientifically-
minded people, however, there are specific
measurements, components, details, and proportions
to describe various parts of a letter. While these
won’t tell you what makes a typeface good, they will
at least give you the right words to use when you
discuss the benefits of a particular face over another.
You can say “I hate the x-height on Such-a-Gothic”
or “These descenders just don’t work for me”
or “Please, may I see something with a smaller cap
height?” and you’ll know what you are talking about.</p></h5>

<h6><p>Rhythm and contrast keep coming up when discussing
good music and good typographic design.
They are concepts that also apply to spoken
language, as anyone who has had to sit through a
monotonous lecture will attest; the same tone, volume
and speed of speech will put even the most
interested listener into dreamland. Every now and
again the audience needs to be shaken, either by a
change in voice or pitch, by a question being posed,
or by the speaker talking very quietly and then suddenly
shouting. An occasional joke also works, just
as the use of a funny typeface can liven up a page.
